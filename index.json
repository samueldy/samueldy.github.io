Remediation approaches such as bacterial consumption (i.e., biological nitrate reduction) and ion-exchange (i.e., physical separation) are widespread and scalable, but have significant drawbacks. For example, biological reduction is infeasible for wastewater streams containing heavy metals, as these can poison the bacteria, and physical separation methods produce a concentrated nitrate brine stream which must then be stored or processed.\nElectrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO3RR)\n","date":1599947716,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599947716,"objectID":"778cc787e46d6b21ea664f7179ec6b21","permalink":"/project/pt-ru-alloying/","publishdate":"2020-09-12T17:55:16-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/pt-ru-alloying/","section":"project","summary":"Alloying Pt and Ru can increase the activity and selectivity of transition metal electrocatalysts.","tags":["catalysis","nitrate reduction","NO3RR"],"title":"PtRu Alloys as Active Nitrate Reduction Electrocatalysts","type":"project"},{"authors":["Samuel D.
