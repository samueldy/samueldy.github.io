Young"],"categories":[],"content":"Humans contribute over 108 tonnes of reactive nitrogen to the environment each year, largely from fertilizer runoff and industrial processes.1 A major consequence is that aqueous nitrate (NO3–) is one of the most widespread water pollutants.2,3 Consuming nitrate has been linked to infant methemoglobinemia (\u0026ldquo;blue baby syndrome\u0026rdquo;), childbirth complications, and ovarian cancer.2,4 High nitrate levels in lakes and oceans also cause mass death of aquatic life through eutrophication (see Figure 1).5 Finding an effective strategy to balance the nitrogen cycle is a National of Academy of Engineering Grand Challenge.6 Concentrated nitrate also exists in low-level nuclear waste,7 and could facilitate spent fuel recovery if removed from the waste stream.8\nThe electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is a promising strategy for aqueous denitrification. It converts nitrates to benign or valuable products, such as nitrogen gas (N2) or ammonia (NH3). Unlike thermocatalytic, physical, or biological denitrification, the NO3RR does not require additional chemicals or generate a secondary waste stream.9 This makes NO3RR approaches desirable for modular, decentralized applications. A technoeconomic analysis of low-level nuclear waste found that using the NO3RR to convert nitrate to NH3 and N2 gas could be cost-competitive if a sufficiently stable, active, and selective catalyst exists.10 However, researchers have yet to identify such an electrocatalyst.\nMy research focuses on discovering active, selective, and stable electrocatalysts to promote NO3RR. I am currently studying bimetallic alloys of earth-abundant metals as well as metal sulfides for this reaction, in collaboration with experimental researchers in the Nirala Singh lab at University of Michigan. Recent projects include an examination of how PtRu alloy composition affects catalyst activity as well as whether Rh sulfides are resistant to halide poisoning.\n  N. Gruber, J.N.
