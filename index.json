It converts nitrates to benign or valuable products, such as nitrogen gas (N2) or ammonia (NH3). Unlike thermocatalytic, physical, or biological denitrification, the NO3RR does not require additional chemicals or generate a secondary waste stream.9 This makes NO3RR approaches desirable for modular, decentralized applications. A technoeconomic analysis of low-level nuclear waste found that using the NO3RR to convert nitrate to NH3 and N2 gas could be cost-competitive if a sufficiently stable, active, and selective catalyst exists.10 However, researchers have yet to identify such an electrocatalyst.\nMy research focuses on discovering active, selective, and stable electrocatalysts to promote NO3RR. I am currently studying bimetallic alloys of earth-abundant metals as well as metal sulfides for this reaction, in collaboration with experimental researchers in the Nirala Singh lab at University of Michigan. Recent projects include an examination of how PtRu alloy composition affects catalyst activity as well as whether metal sulfides are resistant to halide poisoning.\nPtRu Alloys Basic schematic of NO3RR reactions and species The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) converts nitrate (NO3–) ions in water to benign or valuable products, such as nitrogen (N2) gas, ammonia (NH3), hydroxylamine (NH2OH), or ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3).11 The rate of conversion and selectivity towards each product depends on a complex reaction mechanism and operating conditions such as solution pH and applied cell voltage. On transition metal surfaces at moderately low (\u0026lt; 1 M) nitrate concentrations and, NO3RR follows a reaction mechanism involving dissociation of surface-bound NO3– to other surface-bound nitrogen intermediates, as well as surface reaction between these intermediates and surface-bound H.12 This mechanism appears below:13\nSimplified NO3RR mechanism and transition state intermdiates A major challenge in commercializing aqueous-phase electrocatalytic denitrification is the discovery of a sufficiently active, selective, and stable electrocatalyst. Such an electrocatalyst must also attain high activity and selectivity at relatively low (\u0026lt; 1 V) overpotentials.\nOf the pure transition metals, Rh is the most active towards NO3RR, as the proposed rate-limiting step (dissociation of NO3* to NO2* and O*) requires a high coverage of NO3, and Rh is able to bind NO3 to its surface more strongly than other metals do. However, Rh is very expensive (~$8,300/oz) and rare, so it is not a practical choice for widespread denitrification applications.\nPrevious and recent studies have investigated the performance of bimetallic alloys for nitrate reduction and have demonstrated that alloy catalysts can often achieve performance that is better than either pure metal alone. This is accomplished through ligand, strain, and ensemble effects.14 For example, alloying Pt and Sn helps increase the rate of the NO3RR rate-limiting step (nitrate dissociation) and also makes the reaction more selective toward producing hydroxylamine.15 Additionally, a Cu50Ni50 alloy was shown to be six times as active as pure Cu at 0 V vs. RHE.16 It was also shown that the NO3RR activity on the CuNi alloy is a function of the alloy composition, and that there exists an optimal composition that maximizes activity.\nOur previous computational work13 predicted that Pt3Ru is a highly active alloy for NO3RR. Our research around PtRu alloys explores whether this is true, and whether NO3RR activity depends on PtRu alloy composition, as it does for CuNi alloys. Preliminary experimental and computational studies suggest that NO3RR activity on PtxRuy alloys is indeed a function of alloy composition, and is maximized at an approximate composition of Pt78Ru22. We are also interested in investigating\nhow PtRu alloy composition impacts the selectivity of the reaction towards one or more products, which step in the reaction is rate-determining at a variety of alloy compositions and potentials, the stability of PtRu alloys in acidic media during long periods of operation, and the denitrification cost per …","date":1600717750,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600717750,"objectID":"6aa44fe8c24c9b54150a29fe35bde2b5","permalink":"https://samueldy.github.io/project/no3rr/","publishdate":"2020-09-21T15:49:10-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/no3rr/","section":"project","summary":"Electrocatalysis is a promising approach to remediating nitrate-contaminated water.","tags":["catalysis","environment"],"title":"Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction","type":"project"},{"authors":["Samuel D. Young"],"categories":["umich"],"content":"My larger vision for alloy research is to use machine learning (ML) and microkinetic knowledge to discover highly active and selective electrocatalysts that are presently unknown. Of the potentially millions of materials (such as intermetallics,1 low- and high-entropy metal alloys,2 metal sulfides,3 and single atoms4) that might be active and selective for the nitrate reduction reaction, it is impossible to know ahead of time which of them are the most performant. Traditional evaluation of catalyst figures of merit (e.g., intuition-guided experiments or DFT calculations on a few catalysts at a time) are far too slow to screen a catalyst space of this size. However, ML promises to accelerate this process by providing ways to more cheaply evaluate a potential catalyst’s figures of merit.5,6\nComparison of experimental, DFT-only, and ML-assisted pathways for estimating catalyst performance. Once trained with active learning, the ML model can exploit adsorbate scaling relations, BEP (Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi) relations, and volcano surface calculations to cheaply calculate binding energies, reaction activation barriers, and catalyst activity, respectively. ML prediction is usually at least O(103) times faster than DFT prediction. Supervised ML learns correlations between sets of input and output training data to gain the ability to predict what output should result from a new input. My research focuses on training supervised ML models to act as surrogate DFT calculators, a scheme which can estimate binding energies approximately 103 times faster than analogous DFT calculation. In this scheme, a supervised ML model predicts a binding energy given only the geometry and atomic identities of an adsorbed slab. If trained on enough data, such a model could screen a large catalyst space in a more reasonable amount of time by rapidly predicting whether a binding energy falls within a window known to lead to high catalyst activity. This would greatly accelerate the search for a performant catalyst.\nSeveral software packages implement some of the features useful for constructing these models. The GASpy software package7 automates the combinatorial calculation of potentially thousands of adsorption energies of common monodentate adsorbates across multiple facets on bielemental crystal structures. It uses the Atomic Simulation Environment8 to carry out atomic transformations and has been used to calculate CO and H binding energies on bimetallic alloys7 and, more recently, energies on Cu alloys for nitrate-to-ammonia reduction.9 The Atomate10 and Rocketsled11 packages automate many of the same tasks for workflows built on the Pymatgen12 library.\nSeveral machine learning (ML) models have been developed to predict binding energy from the geometry and identity of the atoms of an adsorbed slab model. A number of featurization algorithms have emerged to encode this atomic geometry into translation- and rotation-invariant ML features, such as the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) representation13, the moment tensor potential (MTP) representation14, and the many-body tensor representation (MBTR)15. There is also a class of exciting models called crystal graph convolutional neural networks (CGCNNs), which function by encoding information about each atom and chemical bond in a topological graph representing a bulk crystal structure. This allows the convolutional and pooling layers to extract features relevant to that crystal16. This model was later adapted for surface catalysis by additionally encoding information about the local atomic geometry around each slab and adsorbate atom17 (see figure below) and further improved by including information about each atom’s electron configuration18.\nActive learning is another important technology relevant to catalyst ML problems. Active learning is a strategy used when a training data set is small and obtaining more training data is costly. The high cost of DFT calculations means that most DFT-based catalysis data sets are small. Active learning can simultaneously refine the accuracy of a ML model and build a training data set by strategically selecting new training data to evaluate with DFT This approach helps minimize the number of expensive DFT calculations that must occur. The figure below illustrates pool-based sampling,19 one way of implementing active learning.\nActive learning workflows obtain new data based on an acquisition function, which is an algorithmic approach for selecting data in a manner that constructs the model as cheaply as possible. One major acquisition function is the expected improvement acquisition function,20 which provides a good balance between improving model accuracy and exploring unstudied catalyst structures that may have desirable figures of merit.21\nOur insights about which acquisition functions and featurization protocols create the most accurate and generalizable surrogate DFT models will enable many more researchers in catalysis to exploit the newest …","date":1599949043,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599949043,"objectID":"948c9e5941437631ffc52f0bda9501b5","permalink":"https://samueldy.github.io/project/alloy-ml/","publishdate":"2020-09-12T18:17:23-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/alloy-ml/","section":"project","summary":"Active machine learning can accelerate the search for highly active, stable, and selective catalysts.","tags":["catalysis","ml"],"title":"Machine Learning for Alloy Catalyst Discovery","type":"project"},{"authors":["Samuel D.

Herein, we give our perspective on metal oxynitrides (A*x*B*y*O*w*N*z*) as an emerging and underexplored materials class for e-NRR. We contrast the activity, selectivity, and stability of metal oxynitrides with those of their metal nitride and metal oxide counterparts. We discuss the different possible e-NRR reaction mechanisms on metal oxynitrides, emphasize challenges related to using metal oxynitrides for e-NRR, and provide an outlook for future research.

Electrocatalytic reduction is a sustainable route to remediate nitrate while generating useful products such as NH3 or N2. Here we report density functional theory predictions of intrinsic nitrate reduction rates on PtRu random surface alloy models of compositions from Pt100 through Pt50Ru50. Density functional theory calculations predict increasing nitrate binding strength with increasing Ru composition and a maximum in nitrate reduction activity at 25 at% Ru surface composition. The calculations are consistent with experimental activity measurements of nitrate reduction on synthesized platinum-ruthenium catalysts (PtxRuy/C, x = 48--100%). These experiments show that PtxRuy/C alloys are more active than Pt/C, with Pt78Ru22/C the most active of them all (six times more active than Pt/C at 0.1 V vs. RHE). This maximum in activity arises from a transition from nitrate dissociation as the rate-determining step to a new rate-determining step at higher Ru content. Linear adsorbate scaling and Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi relationships exist on the model alloys with N and O binding energies as the descriptors. That such relationships exist with the same descriptors as used in our previous computational study of nitrate reduction on pure metals suggests that prior nitrated reduction microkinetic models developed for pure metals can be extended to alloys. This finding will greatly accelerate the search for performant nitrate reduction electrocatalysts through high-throughput screening and machine learning. Our work demonstrates that electrocatalyst performance for the nitrate reduction reaction is tunable by changing the adsorption strength of the reacting species through alloying. Beyond catalysis, our findings can also be applied to accelerate the discovery of other energy-relevant materials, such as photovoltaics, superconductors, and thermoelectrics.","tags":[],"title":"ACS Spring 2021: Platinum-Ruthenium Alloys as Electrocatalysts for Efficient Aqueous Nitrate Reduction","type":"event"},{"authors":["Zixuan Wang","Samuel D.
